//! The Emela language server (spec 0033), started by `emela lsp`.
//!
//! Speaks LSP over stdio: diagnostics cover every error the frontend can emit
//! — collected across declarations, not just the first — and completion is
//! context-aware (import paths, `match`/`catch` variants, `uses` effects,
//! `::` type paths, keywords, and in-scope names). The protocol layer is
//! hand-written on serde_json, like the rest of the CLI.
