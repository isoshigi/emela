//! Qualified-name resolution for top-level functions (spec 0037).
//!
//! After import expansion, every top-level function carries the qualifier it is
//! addressed by (`Function::module_path`): the written import path for a
//! function of an imported module, `[EffectName]` for an effect operation, and
//! empty for the compilation root's own functions. Its *full path* is
//! `module_path + [name]`.
//!
//! A bare name resolves only within the referring module (spec 0037 R3); a
//! public function of an imported module is called by any non-empty suffix of
//! its full path ending at `name` (`list.map`, `std.list.map`); an effect
//! operation is called `Io.print` from inside a `uses { Io }` scope. Private
//! functions never resolve across module boundaries (R5).
//!
//! [`FnTable`] indexes every function by all such suffixes so a call/reference
//! path resolves to exactly one function, errors as ambiguous when several
//! match, or is unknown when none match. The same table drives both the type
//! checker (which needs the resolved signature) and lowering (which needs the
//! backend emit name), so the two passes never disagree on what a path denotes.
