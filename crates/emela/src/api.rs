//! Filesystem-free, string-based entry points for embedding the Emela
//! compiler in-process — for example the WebAssembly playground that runs the
//! compiler in the browser.
//!
//! These mirror the `check`, `ir`, and `build` CLI commands but take the source
//! as a string and never touch the filesystem. The embedded std modules (spec
//! 0038) resolve as usual — `import std.io` works with no filesystem — but
//! there is no package search path, so any other `import` fails to resolve;
//! everything else compiles exactly as the CLI would.
